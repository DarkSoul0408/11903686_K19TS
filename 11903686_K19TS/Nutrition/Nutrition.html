			Beneficial Carbohydrates, Beneficial Fats or Omega 3’s and Seasonings. Depending on your Meal Plan, you will create meals that have either approximately 25 grams
			 of protein and 400 calories, or 40 grams of protein and 600 calories. Using the Meal Builder, you can select the exact foods you need to create your healthy,
			  balanced meals.</p>
		<p>First, choose the column that corresponds to the meal you are going to build. Then, select the amounts of food that are listed in each food group and combine 
			items in a variety of ways to create healthy, balanced meals.</p>
